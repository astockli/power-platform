# Manage email notifications to admins
The service team regularly sends email notifications to the administrators in your organization. Now, using a new cmdlets for Power Platform Admin Center, you have control over who should receive these email communications. As an administrator, you can set up a list of additional recipients that you choose. 

For example, you can add to the list of recipients:  

* People outside of your organization, such as your partners.  
* People inside and outside of your company.  

If you have been added as an additional recipient, and you want to stop receiving email notifications, please contact your admin. If youâ€™re not sure who your admin is, see: [Find your administrator or support person](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/find-admin).  

# Obtain a list of email to be notified
If you need to pull a list of email addresses that will receive admin notification use the Get-AdminPowerAppCdsAdditionalNotificationEmails cmdlet.  It will return email addresses of users, other than default admins, linked to an environment that receive notifications.

## Send email notifications to multiple recipients  
By default, admins will receive update notifications. You can add others to receive update notifications using the Set-AdminPowerAppCdsAdditionalNotificationEmails cmdlet.  It will allow you to set email addresses of users linked to an environment, other than default admins, that should receive notifications.
